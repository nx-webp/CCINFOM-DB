# CCINFOM-DB

This is Group 3's implementation of an airline database!

To start, you need the AbsoluteLayout.jar and the MySQLConnector-J.jar for it to work.

Change the url, username, and password variables in the ViewController.java file to your own mySQL url, mySQL username, and mySQL password.
